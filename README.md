# Instagram-post-integration-with-Discord
With the Covid-19 pandemic forcing us to embrace online communication more then ever before, organizations are increasingly reliant on social media platforms to engage with their audience.

With Instagram having proven time and again to be a key player in the social media space, and discord emerging as the platform of choice for gamers, as well as acting as a social hub for many community's, I felt it important to create a guide for anyone who would like to automate the process of posting an announcement to their discord server about a recent Instagram post.


## Project goals
To guide a user through the process of sending automated notifications on discord about a new Instagram photo post on their Instagram page
